  <h1>Rampart Ridge Loop</h1>
  <h3>My First Hike</h3>
  
  <p>My love for hiking started Fall of 2011 and was introduced to me by one of my good friends at work.  He speaks highly of Mount Rainier so I figured my first hike will be in one of Washington State's finest National Park.  My inexperience of the outdoor acitvity triggered him to asked me a question, "what level do you want to hike?"  Apparently the trails are categorized in three levels: easy, moderate and difficult.</p>

<p>I go to the gym every morning during the weekdays running on the treadmill for 15 to 30 minutes, followed by strength training for another 30 minutes then head to the tennis court with my buddies to hit these fuzzy yellow-green balls for 45 more minutes.  So as far as I know I am in good shape!  Right??? I answered him back, "let's go hike a moderate trail."</p>

<p>We scheduled our hike the following Saturday and decided to tackle Rampart Ridge Loop in Longmire.  Brief synopsis of the trail: Round trip distance is approximately 4.6 miles with an elevation gain of 1339 feet.  Online references indicate hiking time should only take 2.5 - 3 hours.  At that time I have no idea what all of this means.</p>

<p>Hiking day:  Geared in blue jeans, t-shirt, thermal shirt, heavy sweatshirt, a baseball cap and a pair of beat up tennis shoes.  Carrying a black JanSport backpack filled with trail mix protein bars, 6 bottles of water, a pair of socks, extra shirt, bug spray and a towel--"I am now a hiker".</p>

<p>After finding a good spot to park and securing our vehicle we head to the trail head.  The trail can be hiked in either direction, excited and not knowing what to expect we decided to go clockwise--we started to the left of trail for those who can't tell time.  As we begin our steady climb on the uphill towards the first switchback I find myself sucking air already.  A few more steps I was taking off my heavy sweatshirt and using that as an excuse to my friend so I can stop and take a breather.  Remember, I am in shape!</p>

<p>After climbing a few more switchbacks I figured the hike will keep on going for more than a mile uphill; at that point I loudly declared to my friend that this trail is not "fucking moderate".  That was just the beginning of my adventure and it never dittered me from stopping.  More than fifty different hikes followed after in six different states with all sorts of hiking levels. </p>
